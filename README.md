# Server Mute

ServerMute is a basic plugin for PocketMine-MP Servers to keep the entire server from talking!

## Installation

This plugin is a simple drop and restart plugin. Simply download the `.phar` from the (COMING SOON) releases page, throw it into your `plugins` directory, and restart your server.

## Usage

You can mute the entire server with one command:

```/servermute or /sm```
